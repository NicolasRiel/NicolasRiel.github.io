My research lies at the intersection of phase equilibrium modeling, reactive fluid and magma transport, and 3-D geodynamic modeling. 

Currently, my work focuses on three primary targets:

* The development of MAGEMin, a thermodynamic equilibrium modeling set of tools tailored for geodynamic modeling coupling and systematic petrological applications.
* The chemical evolution of the crust during magma and fluid transfer, investigated through structural analysis, thermodynamic modeling, geochemical data integration, and coupled thermo-mechanical simulations.
* 2D and 3D geodynamic modeling of subduction initiation and associated mass and heat transfer processes, with implications for plate tectonics and lithospheric evolution.
